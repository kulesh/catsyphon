Add columns to conversations table:\n   - message_count INTEGER DEFAULT 0\n   - epoch_count INTEGER DEFAULT 0  \n   - files_count INTEGER DEFAULT 0\n2. Update counts during ingestion (ingest_conversation)\n3. Add database triggers to keep counts in sync\n4. Migration to backfill existing counts\n5. Change get_with_counts() to simple SELECT with no joins\n\n**Alternative: Correlated Subqueries**\nReplace joins with subqueries (better than current, not as fast as denormalized):\n```python\n(SELECT COUNT(*) FROM messages WHERE conversation_id = c.id) as msg_count\n```\n\n**Files to Modify:**\n- backend/src/catsyphon/models/db.py (add count columns)\n- backend/src/catsyphon/db/repositories/conversation.py (update get_with_counts)\n- backend/src/catsyphon/pipeline/ingestion.py (update counts on insert)\n- Create Alembic migration with backfill\n- backend/tests/test_db/test_conversation_repository.py (update tests)\n\n**Performance Impact:**\n- Current: 3-5 seconds for 20 conversations\n- After fix: \u003c100ms for 20 conversations (30-50x faster)\n\n**Testing:**\n- Verify counts match before/after migration\n- Test count updates during ingestion\n- Load test with 1000+ conversations\n- EXPLAIN ANALYZE to verify no Cartesian product","status":"closed","priority":0,"issue_type":"bug","created_at":"2025-11-13T00:03:40.813207-05:00","updated_at":"2025-11-13T00:13:22.133155-05:00","closed_at":"2025-11-13T00:13:22.133155-05:00","source_repo":"."}
