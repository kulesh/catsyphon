API semantics: Should parsing happen BEFORE pushing to API?\n   - Option A: API accepts ParsedConversation/ParsedMessage objects (parsing done by caller)\n   - Option B: API accepts raw JSON and handles parsing internally\n2. How to represent diffs in API payload?\n   - Incremental updates for modified files\n   - Full file re-ingestion vs. delta updates\n3. Authentication/authorization for watch daemon → API calls\n4. Error handling: How should watch daemon handle API failures?\n\nCurrent architecture:\n- watch.py: monitors FS → parses → calls ingest_conversation()\n- upload.py: receives files → parses → calls ingest_conversation()\n\nDesired architecture:\n- watch.py: monitors FS → sends to upload API\n- upload.py: receives files/diffs → parses → calls ingest_conversation()\n\nBenefits:\n- Single source of truth for ingestion\n- Easier to test and maintain\n- Consistent error handling and tracking\n- Could enable remote watch agents in future","status":"open","priority":2,"issue_type":"task","created_at":"2025-11-21T12:57:49.071892-05:00","updated_at":"2025-11-21T12:57:49.071892-05:00"}

There is no segmentation algorithm to detect conversation restarts, topic shifts, or logical groupings of messages within a conversation.\n\n## Current Implementation\n\n**Location:** `backend/src/catsyphon/pipeline/ingestion.py` (lines 586-599)\n\n**Code:**\n```python\n# Step 4: Create Epoch (one epoch per conversation for now)\n# TODO: Implement multi-epoch detection based on conversation restarts\nepoch = epoch_repo.create_epoch(\n    conversation_id=conversation.id,\n    sequence=0,  # Always 0 - no segmentation\n    start_time=parsed.start_time,\n    end_time=parsed.end_time,\n    intent=tags.get(\"intent\") if tags else None,\n    outcome=tags.get(\"outcome\") if tags else None,\n    sentiment=tags.get(\"sentiment\") if tags else None,\n    sentiment_score=tags.get(\"sentiment_score\") if tags else None,\n)\n```\n\n**Current Behavior:**\n- Each conversation → 1 epoch (sequence=0)\n- All messages assigned to that single epoch\n- Hardcoded `epoch_count=1` in conversation model\n\n## What Needs to Be Implemented\n\n1. **Restart Detection Logic:**\n   - Analyze message sequences to detect conversation boundaries\n   - Identify restart points (long time gaps, new tasks, topic shifts)\n   - Segment messages into multiple epochs per conversation\n\n2. **Segmentation Heuristics (Options):**\n   - Timestamp gap analysis (e.g., \u003e30 min gaps)\n   - Topic modeling (detect subject changes)\n   - User prompt patterns (\"new task:\", \"let's move on\", etc.)\n   - Tool usage patterns (switches between different file sets)\n   - Error/success boundaries (epoch ends after success/failure)\n\n3. **Update Sequence Tracking:**\n   - Dynamic `sequence` field (0, 1, 2, etc.)\n   - Dynamic `epoch_count` in conversation model\n   - Proper epoch ordering for message assignment\n\n## Code Locations That Need Changes\n\n**Primary:**\n- `backend/src/catsyphon/pipeline/ingestion.py` (line 588): Replace single epoch creation with segmentation loop\n- Add new method: `_should_start_new_epoch()` (referenced in docs but not implemented)\n\n**Supporting:**\n- Update hardcoded values:\n  - Line 554: `iteration_count=1` → dynamic detection\n  - Line 711: `epoch_count=1` → actual count\n  - Lines 832, 844, 1089: Similar single-epoch patterns in incremental updates\n\n**Tests:**\n- Update `test_pipeline_ingestion.py` to verify multi-epoch scenarios\n- Add tests for segmentation heuristics\n\n## Infrastructure Status\n\n**✅ Ready:**\n- Database schema fully supports multiple epochs (sequence field, indexes, cascade deletes)\n- `EpochRepository.get_next_sequence()` method exists for multi-epoch scenarios\n- Canonicalization system already handles epoch boundaries in sampling\n- All relationships properly configured\n\n**❌ Not Implemented:**\n- Segmentation algorithm\n- Conversation restart detection\n- Topic shift detection\n- Any heuristics or rules\n\n## Research Notes\n\n**Relevant Files:**\n- `/backend/src/catsyphon/pipeline/ingestion.py` - Epoch creation\n- `/backend/src/catsyphon/db/repositories/epoch.py` - Epoch repository (lines 70-115)\n- `/backend/src/catsyphon/canonicalization/samplers.py` - Uses epoch boundaries for sampling\n- `/backend/src/catsyphon/models/db.py` - Epoch model (lines 451-501)\n\n**Planned Reference:**\n- Implementation plan doc mentions `_should_start_new_epoch()` method (not in codebase)\n\n## Benefits of Implementation\n\n- More granular sentiment analysis (track mood shifts within conversations)\n- Better understanding of iteration patterns\n- Clearer success/failure attribution\n- Improved canonicalization quality\n- Enhanced analytics on conversation structure","status":"open","priority":2,"issue_type":"feature","created_at":"2025-11-21T18:33:35.402483-05:00","updated_at":"2025-11-21T18:33:35.402483-05:00"}
