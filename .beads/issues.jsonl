API semantics: Should parsing happen BEFORE pushing to API?\n   - Option A: API accepts ParsedConversation/ParsedMessage objects (parsing done by caller)\n   - Option B: API accepts raw JSON and handles parsing internally\n2.

Watch daemon treats \neach file modification as a NEW conversation, creating 800+ duplicate database records for one session\\!\n\n**Root Cause:**\nDeduplication in ingestion.py only checks file_hash:\n```python\nfile_hash = calculate_file_hash(file_path)\nif raw_log_repo.exists_by_file_hash(file_hash):\n    skip_duplicates  # ❌ Hash changes with every message append\\!\n```\n\n**Evidence:**\n- Session 6d241b34-b9bc-4582-bdd9-225b0f2309c2: 805 conversations from ONE file\n- Time span: 207 minutes = ~1 conversation every 15 seconds\n- 20 files in watch dir, but 835 conversations in DB (41x multiplication\\!)\n\n**Impact:**\n- Massive database bloat (800+ duplicate records per session)\n- Incorrect analytics (one session counted 800 times)\n- Performance degradation (unnecessary ingestion processing)\n\n**Solution:**\nAdd session ID deduplication alongside file hash:\n\n1. Parse session_id from file BEFORE full ingestion\n2. Check if conversation with session_id already exists\n3. If exists AND file is being watched live:\n   - Option A: Skip ingestion (wait for session to complete)\n   - Option B: Update existing conversation (append new messages)\n   - Option C: Delete old + create new (replace with latest state)\n4. If exists AND file hash matches: Skip (true duplicate)\n5. If not exists: Create new conversation\n\n**Recommended Approach (Option A):**\nSkip live files, only ingest completed sessions:\n- Add debounce: Wait for file to be stable (no changes for X minutes)\n- Or: Only ingest files older than X minutes\n- Prevents partial session ingestion\n\n**Alternative (Option C - Simpler):**\nUpdate existing conversation with latest data:\n- Find conversation by session_id\n- Delete old messages/epochs/files\n- Re-ingest with updated data\n- Maintain conversation ID (preserve references)\n\n**Files to Modify:**\n- backend/src/catsyphon/pipeline/ingestion.py (add session_id check)\n- backend/src/catsyphon/db/repositories/conversation.py (add get_by_session_id)\n- backend/src/catsyphon/watch.py (add file stability check/debounce)\n- backend/tests/test_pipeline_ingestion.py (test deduplication)\n\n**Testing:**\n- Simulate live file: append messages repeatedly, verify single conversation\n- Test with completed files: verify normal ingestion\n- Test manual re-ingest: verify skip/update behavior\n- Cleanup script: Deduplicate existing database records by session_id\n\n**Migration/Cleanup:**\nCreate script to clean up existing duplicates:\n```sql\n-- Keep only the latest conversation per session_id\nDELETE FROM conversations \nWHERE id NOT IN (\n    SELECT MAX(id) \n    FROM conversations \n    GROUP BY metadata-\u003e\u003e'session_id'\n);\n```","status":"closed","priority":0,"issue_type":"bug","created_at":"2025-11-13T00:26:58.020604-05:00","updated_at":"2025-11-13T01:13:54.228548-05:00","closed_at":"2025-11-13T01:13:54.228548-05:00","source_repo":"."}

This eliminates code duplication and centralizes all ingestion logic.\n\n## Current Architecture Issues\n- Watch daemon and upload API both have parsing + ingestion logic (duplication)\n- Two separate code paths for the same core functionality\n- Hard to maintain consistency between upload and watch flows\n\n## Proposed Architecture\n\n### Watch Daemon (Simplified)\n- Monitor file system events (create, modify, rename)\n- Detect file changes and compute diffs for modifications\n- Forward files/diffs to upload API via HTTP\n- Handle retry logic for failed uploads\n- Track daemon stats (files processed, failed, etc.)\n\n### Upload API (Centralized Ingestion)\n- Accept full files OR incremental diffs/patches\n- Handle parsing (via ParserRegistry)\n- Handle ingestion (via ingest_conversation)\n- Track failures (via track_failure)\n- Return results to caller (watch daemon or web UI)\n\n## API Design Considerations\n\nNeed to design API that supports:\n\n1. **Full file upload** (current):\n   - POST /upload/ with multipart file\n   - Returns upload results\n\n2. **Incremental update** (new):\n   - POST /upload/incremental with file path + diff/patch\n   - Or: POST /upload/ with metadata indicating it's a diff\n   - Returns update results\n\n3. **Metadata to send**:\n   - source_type: 'watch' | 'upload' | 'cli'\n   - source_config_id: UUID (for watch)\n   - file_path: full path on disk\n   - is_incremental: boolean\n   - diff_data: bytes (new content to append)\n   - OR full_content: bytes (complete file)\n\n## Implementation Steps\n\n1. **API Design Phase**:\n   - Design upload API endpoint schema for files + diffs\n   - Document request/response formats\n   - Consider streaming vs. batch uploads\n   - Handle large files efficiently\n\n2. **Update Upload API**:\n   - Extend POST /upload/ to accept both files and diffs\n   - Add incremental update handling\n   - Ensure track_failure() works for all cases\n   - Add validation for diff format\n\n3. **Refactor Watch Daemon**:\n   - Remove parsing logic (ParserRegistry usage)\n   - Remove ingestion logic (ingest_conversation calls)\n   - Add HTTP client to call upload API\n   - Send full file on CREATE events\n   - Send diffs on MODIFY events\n   - Handle API response (success/failure)\n   - Map API errors back to retry queue\n\n4. **Testing**:\n   - Test full file upload from watch daemon\n   - Test incremental updates from watch daemon\n   - Test failure scenarios (API down, invalid files)\n   - Ensure retry logic works correctly\n   - Verify no regression in upload API for web UI\n\n5. **Cleanup**:\n   - Remove duplicated parsing logic from watch.py\n   - Keep track_failure() helper for consistency\n   - Update documentation\n\n## Benefits\n- ✅ Single source of truth for ingestion logic\n- ✅ Simpler watch daemon (thin client)\n- ✅ Easier to test and maintain\n- ✅ Consistent behavior between upload and watch\n- ✅ Better error handling centralized in API\n\n## Open Questions\n- Should diffs be sent as raw bytes or structured format?\n- How to handle large files (\u003e100MB)?\n- Should watch daemon batch multiple file changes?\n- How to preserve file metadata (timestamps, permissions)?\n- Authentication for watch daemon → API calls?","status":"closed","priority":2,"issue_type":"task","created_at":"2025-11-21T11:36:19.177233-05:00","updated_at":"2025-11-21T11:49:54.18486-05:00","closed_at":"2025-11-21T11:49:54.18486-05:00","source_repo":"."}

However:\n- Real work happens across MULTIPLE sessions within a project\n- Claude Code organizes conversations by project directory (e.g., ~/.claude/projects/-Users-kulesh-dev-catsyphon/)\n- Managers need to understand project-level effectiveness, not just individual session logs\n- Analytics (features delivered, problems encountered, agent effectiveness) are meaningless at single-session granularity\n\n## Target User Persona\n\n**Engineering Managers** tracking team AI agent adoption who need to answer:\n- Are AI agents helping the team deliver features faster?\n- Where do developers struggle when working with AI agents?\n- How can we improve the human-AI collaboration?\n- What's the ROI of AI coding assistants on this project?\n\n## Current State (Conversation-Centric)\n\n**Data Model:**\n- Projects table exists but is loosely defined (just name/description)\n- Conversations reference project_id but no aggregation\n- No concept of \"sessions within a project\"\n- Analytics calculated per individual conversation\n\n**UX:**\n- ConversationDetail page shows single session metrics\n- No project-level dashboard\n- No way to see all sessions for a project\n- Timeline view is chronological message log\n\n**Available Data (Per Conversation):**\nFrom research of ConversationDetail API:\n- tags.features (AI-extracted features discussed, max 5)\n- tags.problems (AI-extracted blockers, max 5)\n- tags.patterns (detected patterns: long_conversation, quick_resolution, testing, debugging, etc.)\n- tags.tools_used (bash, git, npm, test, etc.)\n- tags.has_errors (boolean)\n- tags.reasoning (AI explanation)\n- Epoch-level: sentiment scores, intents, outcomes\n- Files touched with line change metrics\n- Message counts, duration, iteration counts\n\n## Desired State (Project-Centric)\n\n**Data Model Enhancement:**\n1. Projects table becomes primary entity\n2. Conversations become \"sessions\" within a project\n3. Parser extracts project info from directory structure\n4. Intermediate representation (ParsedConversation) includes project context\n5. Aggregation queries for project-level metrics\n\n**UX Transformation:**\n1. **Project Detail Page** (NEW) - Manager dashboard showing:\n   - Agent effectiveness across ALL sessions\n   - Features delivered (aggregated from all session tags)\n   - Problems encountered (aggregated blockers)\n   - Tool usage patterns across project\n   - Sentiment trends over time\n   - Developer performance within project\n   - Code impact metrics (total files/lines changed)\n   \n2. **Session List within Project** (NEW)\n   - All conversation sessions for the project\n   - Quick stats per session\n   - Navigate to individual session timeline\n\n3. **Session Detail/Timeline** (Enhanced ConversationDetail)\n   - Tabbed interface: Dashboard vs Timeline\n   - Session-level metrics and insights\n   - Link back to project context\n\n**Navigation Flow:**\nProjects List → Project Dashboard → Session List → Session Detail/Timeline\n\n## Prerequisites (MUST complete first)\n\n### 1. Data Model Changes\n- [ ] Enhance projects table with aggregation fields\n- [ ] Add project directory path field\n- [ ] Update conversation schema to better link to project\n- [ ] Add project-level stats/cache table\n- [ ] Migration for existing data\n\n### 2. Parser Updates\n- [ ] Extract project info from Claude Code directory structure\n- [ ] Parse project metadata from directory name/path\n- [ ] Associate conversations with correct project\n- [ ] Handle project discovery during ingestion\n\n### 3. Intermediate Representation\n- [ ] Update ParsedConversation to include project context\n- [ ] Add project-level aggregation logic\n- [ ] Ensure backwards compatibility\n\n### 4. API Enhancements\n- [ ] Add /projects/{id}/sessions endpoint\n- [ ] Add /projects/{id}/stats endpoint (aggregated metrics)\n- [ ] Update conversation endpoints to include project context\n- [ ] Add project filtering/grouping\n\n## Epic Goals\n\n### Primary Goal\nEnable managers to understand AI agent effectiveness at PROJECT level, not just individual sessions.\n\n### Key Deliverables\n\n1. **Project Dashboard Page** showing:\n   - Success rate across all sessions\n   - Total features delivered\n   - Common blockers/problems\n   - Tool adoption patterns\n   - Developer performance trends\n   - Time investment metrics\n   - Sentiment analysis over time\n\n2. **Information Density Focus**:\n   - Charts and visualizations (not just tables)\n   - Actionable insights surfaced prominently\n   - Comparative metrics (project vs team average - later phase)\n   - Drill-down from project → sessions → details\n\n3. **Manager-Friendly UX**:\n   - Answer \"Is AI helping?\" at a glance\n   - Show trends over time (improving vs degrading)\n   - Highlight friction points for intervention\n   - Surface learnings and recommendations\n\n## Success Metrics\n\n- Managers can assess project health in \u003c30 seconds\n- Clear answer to \"Are we delivering faster with AI?\"\n- Identification of improvement opportunities\n- Visibility into team AI adoption patterns\n\n## Dependencies\n\n- Blocked by: Data model refactor (project-session relationship)\n- Blocks: Comparative analytics (project vs team benchmarks)\n- Related to: Epic 3 (Real-Time Event System - could show live project activity)\n\n## Technical Notes\n\n**Claude Code Directory Structure:**\n```\n~/.claude/projects/\n  ├── -Users-kulesh-dev-catsyphon/\n  │   ├── conversation_001.jsonl\n  │   ├── conversation_002.jsonl\n  │   └── conversation_003.jsonl\n  ├── -Users-kulesh-dev-other-project/\n  │   └── conversation_001.jsonl\n```\n\nPath parsing logic needed to extract:\n- Working directory from escaped path\n- Group conversations by parent directory\n- Associate with existing or create new project\n\n**Data Already Available** (no new tagging needed):\nAll analytics use existing API fields from conversation tags JSONB\n\n**No Backend ML Changes Required:**\nTagging infrastructure already extracts features, problems, patterns, tools, sentiment - just need to aggregate across sessions\n\n## Estimated Effort\nMedium-Large (2-3 weeks)\n- Data model refactor: 3-4 days\n- Parser updates: 2-3 days\n- API enhancements: 2-3 days\n- Frontend project dashboard: 4-5 days\n- Testing and polish: 2-3 days\n\n## Open Questions\n1. How to handle projects without directory info (uploaded files)?\n2. Should we auto-create projects from directory structure?\n3. How to handle project renames/moves?\n4. Should project dashboard be the new default landing page?","status":"closed","priority":1,"issue_type":"epic","created_at":"2025-11-18T15:09:49.899407-05:00","updated_at":"2025-11-18T21:11:38.860211-05:00","closed_at":"2025-11-18T21:11:38.860211-05:00","source_repo":".","labels":["analytics","manager-ux","modernization","project-centric"]}
